# h0

For this task I wrote a basic Java hello world script

<img width="990" height="431" alt="{88528E7D-2646-4C29-89B5-E918D0E4293A}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdce557a-eb4c-4033-b0f4-c2d5f98cad5f" />

Getting the binary for this was suprisingly difficult for me, this was because my code editor had a built in decompiler so when I opened the class file, I showed this:

<img width="1641" height="344" alt="{89A85FF1-BA1B-4686-989A-96AD6F8C5A53}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/251f238a-28b5-41d7-a220-8b754bb86a0c" />

But then I opened the file with Notepad and I was able to see the binary and it looked something like this:

<img width="2003" height="548" alt="{6C9898EF-87F5-4A19-834A-2EE1619035C4}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9620ea7-ef84-4e9e-bd70-4da25ccb2460" />

I could make out some words but it is generally gibberish to me
